<!-- only if there's a hero, display.
  use ngModel for data-binding. bind it to hero.name.
  put hero's name in the input.
  ERROR: Can't bind to 'ngModel' since it isn't a known property of 'input'.
  SOLUTION: FormsModule in app.module.ts.
 -->
<div *ngIf="hero">
  We selected <input [(ngModel)]="hero.name">
</div>
