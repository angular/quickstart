# Electron Angular 2 Quick start

This repository holds the TypeScript source code of the [angular.io quickstart](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html),
the foundation for most of the documentation samples and potentially a good starting point for your application.

This fork has added support for the [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron) shell, which is very useful when what you are
building is targetting native platforms (Windows, OS X and Linux).   

## Prerequisites

Node.js and npm are essential to Angular 2 development. 
    
<a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node" target="_blank" title="Installing Node.js and updating npm">
Get it now</a> if it's not already installed on your machine.
 
**Verify that you are running at least node `v4.x.x` and npm `3.x.x`**
by running `node -v` and `npm -v` in a terminal/console window.
Older versions produce errors.

We recommend [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) for managing multiple versions of node and npm.

## Install npm packages

> See npm and nvm version notes above

Install the npm packages described in the `package.json` and verify that it works:

**Attention Windows Developers:  You must run all of these commands in administrator mode**.

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

> If the `typings` folder doesn't show up after `npm install` please install them manually with:

> `npm run typings -- install`

The `npm start` command first compiles the application, 
then simultaneously re-compiles and runs the `lite-server`.
Both the compiler and the server watch for file changes.

Shut it down manually with Ctrl-C.

You're ready to write your application.

### npm scripts

We've captured many of the most useful commands in npm scripts defined in the `package.json`:

* `npm start` - runs the compiler and a server at the same time, both in "watch mode". Also starts the Electron shell.
* `npm run tsc` - runs the TypeScript compiler once.
* `npm run tsc:w` - runs the TypeScript compiler in watch mode; the process keeps running, awaiting changes to TypeScript files and re-compiling when it sees them.
* `npm run lite` - runs the [lite-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lite-server), a light-weight, static file server, written and maintained by
[John Papa](https://github.com/johnpapa) and
[Christopher Martin](https://github.com/cgmartin)
with excellent support for Angular apps that use routing.
* `npm run typings` - runs the typings tool.
* `npm run postinstall` - called by *npm* automatically *after* it successfully completes package installation. This script installs the TypeScript definition files this app requires.
Here are the test related scripts:
* `npm test` - compiles, runs and watches the karma unit tests
* `npm run e2e` - run protractor e2e tests, written in JavaScript (*e2e-spec.js)

## Testing

The QuickStart documentation doesn't discuss testing.
This repo adds both karma/jasmine unit test and protractor end-to-end testing support.

These tools are configured for specific conventions described below.

*It is unwise and rarely possible to run the application, the unit tests, and the e2e tests at the same time.
We recommend that you shut down one before starting another.*

### Unit Tests
TypeScript unit-tests are usually in the `app` folder. Their filenames must end in `.spec`.

Look for the example `app/app.component.spec.ts`.
Add more `.spec.ts` files as you wish; we configured karma to find them.

Run it with `npm test`

That command first compiles the application, then simultaneously re-compiles and runs the karma test-runner.
Both the compiler and the karma watch for (different) file changes.

Shut it down manually with Ctrl-C.

Test-runner output appears in the terminal window.
We can update our app and our tests in real-time, keeping a weather eye on the console for broken tests.
Karma is occasionally confused and it is often necessary to shut down its browser or even shut the command down (Ctrl-C) and
restart it. No worries; it's pretty quick.

The `HTML-Reporter` is also wired in. That produces a prettier output; look for it in `~_test-output/tests.html`.

### End-to-end (E2E) Tests

E2E tests are in the `e2e` directory, side by side with the `app` folder.
Their filenames must end in `.e2e-spec.ts`.

Look for the example `e2e/app.e2e-spec.ts`.
Add more `.e2e-spec.js` files as you wish (although one usually suffices for small projects);
we configured protractor to find them.

Thereafter, run them with `npm run e2e`.

That command first compiles, then simultaneously starts the Http-Server at `localhost:8080`
and launches protractor.  

The pass/fail test results appear at the bottom of the terminal window.
A custom reporter (see `protractor.config.js`) generates a  `./_test-output/protractor-results.txt` file
which is easier to read; this file is excluded from source control.

Shut it down manually with Ctrl-C.
